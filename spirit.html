            <p>You must be the change you wish to see in the world.</p>
            <p>The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</p>
            <p>Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.</p>
            <p>An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.</p>
            <p>A man is but the product of his thoughts; what he thinks, he becomes.</p>
            <p>Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.</p>
            <p>The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.</p>
            <p>You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.</p>
            <p>First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.</p>
            <p>Live as if you were to die tomorrow; learn as if you were to live forever.</p>
